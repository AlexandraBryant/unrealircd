UnrealIRCd 4.0.14-unreleased Release Notes
================================

These release notes are work-in-progress.

==[ CHANGES BETWEEN 4.0.13 AND 4.0.14 ]==
Enhancements:
* New set::plaintext-policy configuration settings. This defines what
  happens to users/ircops/servers that are not using SSL/TLS.
  The default settings are:
  set {
    plaintext-policy {
      user allow; /* allow any user to connect */
      oper warn; /* warn on /OPER if not using SSL/TLS */
      server deny; /* deny servers without SSL/TLS, except localhost */
    };
  };
  You can change each of the three classes to 'allow', 'warn' or 'deny'.
  See: https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::plaintext-policy
  If your services do not run on localhost and link without SSL/TLS
  then you may get an error during linking. In such a case check out:
  https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#ERROR:_Servers_need_to_use_SSL.2FTLS

Major issues fixed:
* None

Minor issues fixed:
* If you had a link block named irc1.example.net and did an outgoing
  connect to this server then the server could introduce himself under
  a different name, such as irc2.example.net. Not a security issue but
  this could be rather confusing. Also confused the autoconnect code.
