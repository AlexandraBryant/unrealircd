UnrealIRCd 4.0.19-dev Release Notes
====================================

This UnrealIRCd version is still under heavy development.
See https://bugs.unrealircd.org/roadmap_page.php for release targets.

Enhancements:
* None

Major issues fixed:
* None

Minor issues fixed:
* Remote includes: ./Config didn't properly detect libcurl on Ubuntu 18
  (and possibly other Linux distributions as well)

Other changes:
* Windows users may be prompted to install the Visual C++ redistributable
  package for Visual Studio 2017. This is because we now build on VS 2017
  instead of VS 2012.

Module coders:
* Windows: Be aware that we now build with Visual Studio 2017. This means
  3rd party modules should be compiled with VS 2017 (or VS 2015) as well.

Future versions:
* We intend to change the default plaintext oper policy from 'warn' to 'deny'
  later this year. This will deny /OPER when used from a non-SSL connection.
  For security, IRC Operators should really use SSL/TLS!
