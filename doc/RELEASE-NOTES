UnrealIRCd 4.2.1-dev Release Notes
===============================

UnrealIRCd 4.2.0 turned out to be very stable. This 4.2.1 version
therefore contains only minor changes and feature enhancements.

If you missed the 4.2.0 release, then consider looking at the previous
release announcement, since it introduced a lot new features:
https://forums.unrealircd.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=8843

Note: there will be no further 4.0.x releases, as 4.2.x is simply the
successor to 4.0.x. If you missed that announcement, then have a look at:
https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#Questions_about_the_new_4.2.x_series

Enhancements:
* Support for Argon2 hashed passwords. 
* New optional module 'antimixedutf8' to combat mixed UTF8 character spam
  (also called freenode spam) that has been plaguing networks.
  See: https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::antimixedutf8

Major issues fixed:
* None

Minor issues fixed:
* By default a user shouldn't be allowed to change to a banned nick,
  unless (s)he has +hoaq in the channel. This was broken since 4.0.0.
  This feature can be disabled via set { check-target-nick-bans no; };

Deprecated:
* The authentication types 'md5', 'sha1' and 'ripemd160' have been
  deprecated because they can be cracked at high speeds. They still
  work, but a warning will be shown on boot and on rehash.
  Please use 'bcrypt' or (even better) the new 'argon2' type instead:
  "./unrealircd mkpasswd argon2" or "/mkpasswd argon2 passwd" on IRC.

Other changes:
* A /* comment in the configuration file is now terminated at the
  first occurance of */, instead of two /* /* requiring two */ */.
  See https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#Nesting_comments
* In the configuration file you can now use } instead of };
  Both forms are accepted. There's no need to change if you don't like it.

Module coders:
* Priorities in command overrides were reversed (was added in 4.2.0).

Future versions:
* We intend to change the default plaintext oper policy from 'warn' to 'deny'
  in the year 2019. This will deny /OPER when used from a non-SSL connection.
  For security, IRC Operators should really use SSL/TLS!
