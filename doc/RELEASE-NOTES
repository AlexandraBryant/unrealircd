UnrealIRCd 4.0.14-unreleased Release Notes
================================

These release notes are work-in-progress.

==[ CHANGES BETWEEN 4.0.13 AND 4.0.14 ]==
Enhancements:
* New set::plaintext-policy configuration settings. This defines what
  happens to users/ircops/servers that are not using SSL/TLS.
  The default settings are:
  set {
    plaintext-policy {
      user allow; /* allow any user to connect */
      oper warn; /* warn on /OPER if not using SSL/TLS */
      server deny; /* deny servers without SSL/TLS, except localhost */
    };
  };
  You can change each of the three classes to 'allow', 'warn' or 'deny'.
  See: https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::plaintext-policy

  Regarding the default choices:
  * Everyone should use SSL/TLS but to deny (or warn) all non-SSL/TLS
    users in the default configuration is a step too far right now.
  * IRCOps have access to sensitive information of many users and should
    really use an encrypted connection. Hence the default 'warn' action.
  * Two UnrealIRCd 4.x servers will always link with SSL/TLS (either
    directly or using STARTTLS), this is the case since version 4.0.0.
    The only new thing is that we now block INCOMING insecure links.
    This is only a problem for you if you meet ALL of these 3 conditions:
    1. You are linking in services or any other non-UnrealIRCd-4.x
       software; AND
    2. You are linking from a remote computer (not localhost); AND
    3. You are not using SSL/TLS for the connection.
    In such a case you will be unable to link without changes. See:
    https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#ERROR:_Servers_need_to_use_SSL.2FTLS

Major issues fixed:

Minor issues fixed:
* If you had a link block named irc1.example.net and did an outgoing
  connect to this server then the server could introduce himself under
  a different name, such as irc2.example.net. Not a security issue but
  this could be rather confusing. Also confused the autoconnect code.
