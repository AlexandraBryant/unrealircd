UnrealIRCd 4.0.14-unreleased Release Notes
================================

These release notes are work-in-progress.

==[ CHANGES BETWEEN 4.0.13 AND 4.0.14 ]==
Enhancements:
* New set::plaintext-policy configuration settings. This defines what
  happens to users/ircops/servers that are not using SSL/TLS.
  The default settings are:
  set {
    plaintext-policy {
      user allow; /* allow any user to connect */
      oper warn; /* warn on /OPER if not using SSL/TLS */
      server deny; /* deny servers without SSL/TLS, except localhost */
    };
  };
  You can change each of the three classes to 'allow', 'warn' or 'deny'.
  See: https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::plaintext-policy
  If your services do not run on localhost and link without SSL/TLS
  then you may get an error during linking. In such a case check out:
  https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#ERROR:_Servers_need_to_use_SSL.2FTLS
* You can now ask UnrealIRCd to verify certificates of server links by:
  link irc1.test.net {
      [..]
      verify-certificate yes;
  };
  This will verify the certificate of the link, making sure it is valid,
  issued for the specified name (irc1.test.net) and given out by a
  trusted Certificate Authority (like Let's Encrypt).
  Obviously, if you use self-signed certificates then you can't use this.
* Introduce a concept called "link security level". This will rate the
  security of your network from 0 to 2. Whenever security is degraded
  due to a new server link UnrealIRCd will print a warning about it.
  See https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Link_security
  This also adds a new command /LINKSECURITY (IRCop-only).
* The plaintext-policy and link-security is shown in "CAP LS".

Major issues fixed:
* None

Minor issues fixed:
* If you had a link block named irc1.example.net and did an outgoing
  connect to this server then the server could introduce himself under
  a different name, such as irc2.example.net. Not a security issue but
  this could cause confusing autoconnect attempts to be printed.
* password::sslclientcert did not accept relative paths
* Compile problem with LibreSSL (regarding SSL_CTX_get0_param)

Other changes:
* The ssl options 'verify-certificate' and 'no-self-signed' have been
  removed. Use link::verify-certificate instead. It makes no sense to
  verify certificates or prevent self signed certificates elsewhere
  such as in vhost or oper, since there is no hostname to match against.
* Weak cipher suites such as 3DES and RC4 are disabled by default but
  previously you could still enable them through set::ssl::ciphers.
  Now you can no longer, since there is no legitimate reason to do so.
* Update cipher suite to work with TLS 1.3. This ensures you can use
  TLS 1.3 in UnrealIRCd 4.0.14+ when OpenSSL supports it (in the future).
* Bump MODDATA_MAX_CLIENT from 8 to 12: needed if you have a lot of
  3rd party modules loaded. Also moved MODDATA_MAX_* to include/config.h

Module coders:
* You can now attach ModData to server objects as well (including &me).
