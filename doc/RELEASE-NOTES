UnrealIRCd 4.2.4 Release Notes
===============================

!!! FIXME !!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

Some introduction.

Some explanation.

Enhancements:
* Improve link error messages
* Enhance WHOX to WHO auto-conversion for "WHO +s serv.er.name"

Major issues fixed:
* The Windows version only accepted very few clients.

Minor issues fixed:
* The Windows version should warn and not error if using old-style regex.
* The 'connthrottle' module incorrectly allowed 0 unknown users in when
  it was throttling, rather than the set rate.
* The 'reputation' module did not show scores for remote users in /WHOIS,
  only after 5 minutes had passed.
* If successfully logged in using SASL then avoid an "You are already
  logged in" error message that could happen due to PASS forwarding.

Module coders / Developers:
* If you are debugging or developing modules then we encourage you to
  use AddressSanitizer. This does come at a 10x performance slowdown
  and can consume a lot more memory, but it is very useful in tracing
  common C mistakes such as out of bounds read/writes, double frees,
  and so on. You will see exactly where a mistake was made.
  To use this, in the last ./Config question you answer: --enable-asan

IRC protocol:
* No changes

Other changes:
* Various HELPOP updates

Future versions:
* We intend to change the default plaintext oper policy from 'warn' to 'deny'
  in the summer of 2019. This will deny /OPER when used from a non-SSL
  connection. For security, IRC Operators should really use SSL/TLS!
