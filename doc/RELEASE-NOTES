UnrealIRCd 4.2.1-dev Release Notes
===============================

UnrealIRCd 4.2.0 turned out to be very stable. This 4.2.1 version
therefore contains only minor changes and feature enhancements.

If you missed the 4.2.0 release, then consider looking at the previous
release announcement, since it introduced a lot new features:
https://forums.unrealircd.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=8843

Note: there will be no further 4.0.x releases, as 4.2.x is simply the
successor to 4.0.x. If you missed that announcement, then have a look at:
https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#Questions_about_the_new_4.2.x_series

Enhancements:
* Support for Argon2 hashed passwords. 
* New optional module 'antimixedutf8' to combat mixed UTF8 character spam
  (also called freenode spam) that has been plaguing networks.
  See: https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::antimixedutf8
* Authentication prompt for non-SASL users:
  We previously introduced the "require sasl" block which allows you to
  force users from certain IP addresses to authenticate with their nickname
  and password via SASL. We now offer a new experimental module called
  'saslemulation' which will help non-SASL users by showing a notice and
  asking them to authenticate to their account via /AUTH <user>:<pass>.
  See https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::sasl-emulation

Configuration changes:
* The operclass privileges have been redone. Since there were 50+ changes
  to the 100+ privileges it makes little sense to list the changes here.
  If, like 99% of the users, you use default operclasses such as "globop"
  and "admin-with-override" then you don't need to do anything.
  However, if you have custom operclass { } blocks then the privileges
  will have to be redone. For more information on the conversion process,
  see https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#New_operclass_permissions
  For the new list of permissions, with much better naming and grouping:
  https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Operclass_permissions
* In the configuration file you can now use } instead of };
  Both forms are accepted. There's no need to change if you don't like it.
* A /* comment in the configuration file is now terminated at the
  first occurance of */, instead of two /* /* requiring two */ */.
  See https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#Nesting_comments

Major issues fixed:
* None

Minor issues fixed:
* By default a user shouldn't be allowed to change to a banned nick,
  unless (s)he has +hoaq in the channel. This was broken since 4.0.0.
  This feature can be disabled via set { check-target-nick-bans no; };

Deprecated:
* The authentication types 'md5', 'sha1' and 'ripemd160' have been
  deprecated because they can be cracked at high speeds. They still
  work, but a warning will be shown on boot and on rehash.
  Please use 'bcrypt' or (even better) the new 'argon2' type instead:
  "./unrealircd mkpasswd argon2" or "/mkpasswd argon2 passwd" on IRC.

Module coders:
* Priorities in command overrides were reversed (was added in 4.2.0).

Future versions:
* We intend to change the default plaintext oper policy from 'warn' to 'deny'
  in the year 2019. This will deny /OPER when used from a non-SSL connection.
  For security, IRC Operators should really use SSL/TLS!
